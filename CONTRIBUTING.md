## Adding a new game

<details>
<summary>To add a new game, you need to follow these steps (<em>click to expand</em>)</summary>

1. Create a new subfolder for your game within the `src` folder. In this example we will call it `chess`
2. Create an `index.html` file containing this template code:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <meta charset="UTF-8" />
       <title>Chess</title>
       <meta name="description" content="add your game description here" />

       <link
         rel="stylesheet"
         href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Varela+Round&display=swap"
       />
       <link rel="stylesheet" href="../brain-gain/main.css" />
       <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="../images/logo-favicon.png" />
     </head>

     <body>
       <core-navbar>Chess</core-navbar>

       <core-modal>
         <div class="modal-header">HOW TO PLAY CHESS</div>
         <p class="modal-text">This is the help modal</p>
       </core-modal>

       Hello world!
       <script type="module" src="../components/script/main.js"></script>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

3. Edit the home page to add a link to your new game, by adding the following code to `src/index.html`:
   <!-- prettier-ignore -->
   ```html
   <a id="chess-btn" href="./chess/index.html" class="games-button" onmouseenter="chessDetails()" onmouseleave="titleShow()">
      <img alt="Chess logo" class="game-button-img" />
      <p id="chess-btn-text">Chess</p>
    </a>
   ```

4. Edit the home page to add a modal for your new game, by adding the following code to `src/index.html`:

   ```html
   <div id="chess-details" class="game-details">
     <p class="game-details-title">Chess</p>
     <br />
     <p class="game-details-text">The description of Chess goes here.</p>
     <img alt="Chess example gameplay" class="game-details-img" />
   </div>
   ```

5. Enable the home page modal for your new game, by adding the following code to `src/brain-gain/index.js`:
   ```js
   function chessDetails() {
     document.getElementById("title-img").style.opacity = "0%";
     document.getElementById("chess-details").style.opacity = "100%";
   }
   ```
6. Make changes to `src/brain-gain/main.css` as required to position the new button
7. To write your first test case, create a new subfolder within `cypress/e2e` called `chess`.
8. Create a test file within `cypress/e2e` called `example.cy.js` containing the following code:

   ```js
   /// <reference types="cypress" />

   describe("e2e tests for chess", () => {
     beforeEach(() => {
       cy.visit("http://localhost:1234/chess/index.html");
       cy.get("[id=close-btn]").click(); // close the help modal
     });

     it("loads without crashing", () => {
       // this is a very basic example
       cy.get("body").should("contain.text", "Hello world");
     });
   });
   ```

9. To test that the link you added in step 3 works, you should consider adding a new test case in `cypress/e2e/homepage.cy.js`. Only [these 3 lines](https://github.com/se310-Team4/KKDZ/blob/66430ef/cypress/e2e/homepage.cy.js#L2-L4) need changing.
10. Replace `chess` in the template code with the name of your game
11. Follow the instructions in the [README](README.md) to start the app. Then open http://localhost:1234/chess in your web browser.
