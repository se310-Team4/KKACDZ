# KKDZ Games
## Project Overview
KKDZ is a growing collection of for-fun mini-games. Each game takes around 5 - 30 minutes to play, making it the perfect option during study breaks, recreational time, or just to de-stress and take your mind off things.

This project is associated with the University of Auckland SOFTENG 310.

Currently, 3 games are being worked on:
- Liedle - a variation of [Wordle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wordle) where the game has a small chance of colouring a letter incorrectly.
- Capidle - the user is presented with a map of a city. The aim of the game is to guess the city in 6 guesses.
- 2048 Expert - a variation of [2048](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2048_%28video_game%29) where 2 (instead of 1) new tiles are added after each move.

We hope to have at least 4 games complete by launch day (18 October 2022).
